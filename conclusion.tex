\section{Conclusion}

In this short presentation, we have seen a number of concepts around using
symbolic statistics that have been recently added to the SymPy project.  At a
low level is the random expression type as a tool for making meaningful
statistical statements over complex expressions. At a high level we hope to
have motivated the use of symbolics in everyday computation.

Just as the article in this section from March
2011~\cite{Terrel2011}, the use of language features to include domain
specifics has led to a natural way of thinking about a difficult subject.
While not covered in this article, the SymPy implementation of random variables
has allowed for a rich set of probabilistic spaces which are available to use
in complex expressions.  The authors invite users to experiment with these
features and contribute back to the project with their own specific interests
and expertise.
