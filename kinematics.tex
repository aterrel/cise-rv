\section{Example 3: Kinematics}

For the final example, we give a more complete simulation from a classical
kinematics.  Just as with simulation codes, one should start adding additional
complexity to the models, slowly.  With symbolic statistics, one must take care
where uncertainty is added or the result will be much more complex than
necessary.

Consider shooting a cannon ball off of a cliff. We ask where will the ball land below?

\label{fig:kinematics}
\vspace{00pt}
\end{figure}
We start by modeling this mathematical problem in SymPy without statistics:

\begin{lstlisting}
    # Symbols for position, velocity, angle, time, and gravity
    >>> x0, y0, yf, v, theta, t, g = symbols('x0 y0 yf v theta t g')
    # x and y positions as a function of time
    >>> x = x0 + v*cos(theta)*t
    >>> y = y0 + v*sin(theta)*t + g/2*t**2
    # Solve y = yf for time to obtain the duration of the flight
    >>> t_impact = solve(y-yf, t)[1]
    # Final x value of cannon ball on impact
    >>> xf = x0 + v*cos(theta)*t_impact
\end{lstlisting}
This code yields the following symbolic solution:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:kinematics_symbolic}
x_f = x_{0} - \frac{v \left(v \sin{\left (\theta \right )} + \sqrt{- 2 g y_{0} + 2 g y_f + v^{2} \sin^{2}{\left (\theta \right )}}\right) \cos{\left (\theta \right )}}{g}
\end{equation}

To obtain numeric results for a particular set of values, we can replace the symbolic variables, $x_0, y_0, y_f, v, \theta, g$ with numeric ones:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> g = -9.8
>>> v, theta = 10, pi/4
>>> x0, y0, yf = 0, 10, 0
>>> xf_num = xf.subs({ 'g': -9.8,
           'v': 10, 'theta': pi/4, 'x0': 0,
           'y0': 10, 'yf': 0} )
>>> xf_num.evalf()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:kinematics_numeric}
x_f = \frac{250}{49} + \frac{50}{49} \sqrt{123} = 16.4189
\end{equation}

The expression in Eqn. \ref{eqn:kinematics_symbolic} is less appealing to the
naked eye since it is hard to visualize its meaning but it serves two
purposes. Because it is a full symbolic description of the problem, it can
provide insight as to the relation of the variables to the
result. Additionally, it serves as a staging ground to produce many numeric
solutions such as the one in Eqn. \ref{eqn:kinematics_numeric}. Once the
mathematical model has been described no further conceptual work is necessary
on the part of the programmer to produce numeric results.

\subsection{Adding Uncertainty}

We now consider the statistical problem. Imagine that we are uncertain about
the initial height of the cannon. Rather than knowing a precise value $y_0 =
10$, we suspect it is distributed normally with variance 1 $y_0 \sim
\N{10}{1}$. Due to this uncertainty $x_f$ no longer has a precise
value. Instead of asking for an exact number, we ask for the
expectation value, variance, or even the full distribution.

Traditionally, this is done either through painstaking algebra (for simple
cases) or by building external codes to sample using Monte Carlo methods. We
now show how SymPy can be used to model this statistical problem and provide
solutions.

Rather than defining $y_0$ as a symbolic or numeric variable, we will declare
it to be a random variable distributed normally with mean 10 and standard
deviation 1.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> y0 = Normal(10,1)
\end{lstlisting}

This variable acts in all ways like a SymPy symbol and so we may still form the
expression in Eqn. \ref{eqn:kinematics_symbolic}. Because this expression now
contain random elements, it itself is random and is active under our
statistical operators.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> E(xf)
\end{lstlisting}

This code follows standard theory to generate the following integral
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{25}{49} \frac{\left(\sqrt{\frac{98}{5} x_{1} + 50} + 5 \sqrt{2}\right) e^{- \frac{1}{2} \left(x_{1} -10\right)^{2}}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\, dx_{1}$$

This integral is challenging and the solution includes special
functions. Fortunately, algorithmic tools are capable of producing exact
analytic solutions. Numeric equivalents are presented below in place of full
expressions which are omitted in the interests of space and clarity.

$$\textrm{E}(x_f) = 16.4099...$$
$$\textrm{var}(x_f) = .2044...$$

In principle, we could ask for the full analytically computed density of $x_f$
although the complexity prohibits any meaningful insight.

\subsection{Dealing with Complexity}

Imagine now a more difficult problem where more of the variables in our model were uncertain
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> v = Uniform(9,11.5) # Uniformly distributed between 9 and 11.5
>>> theta = Normal(pi/4, pi/20)
\end{lstlisting}

Our queries may also become more complex such as, \textit{What is the
probability that theta was greater than $\pi/4$ given that the ball landed
past $x_f>16$?} , $P(\theta>\frac{\pi}{4} | x_f>16)$. Asking this question in
SymPy is just as easy as the example above:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> P(theta>pi/4  ,  xf>16)
\end{lstlisting}
Solving the resultant integral however is substantially more challenging. For
situations like these exact solutions are often infeasible and Monte Carlo
codes are built around the problem. Because this problem statement is now
cleanly separated from the solution code, it is trivial to connect a simple
sampling engine onto SymPy stats allowing all such queries to be approximated
using a simple syntax
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> P(theta>pi/4,  xf>16, numsamples=10000)
0.3428
\end{lstlisting}

This classic problem had demonstrated the iteration one takes in forming more
complicated simulations that encapsulate the uncertainties from physical
measurements. As in the previous example, all the mechanics behind the
statistical operators have been incorporated in the symbolic language in
SymPy.  This gives users a natural path from a model to a more complicated real
world simulation.
