\section{Introduction}

{\bf blab about symbolics}
We note three increasing trends of scientific computing
\begin{enumerate*}
\item Problems are becoming more complex
\item Computational infrastructure is requiring more attention to detail
\item The average programmer is coming from a less technical background
\end{enumerate*}

That is we need to solve more complex science problems on tricker architectures given less specialized users. To solve this issue we look towards adding additional layers of abstraction in the process of describing problems. For example we no longer ask users to write high performance matrix code, instead we use LAPACK. A layer of abstraction a bit higher in the process is the use of symbolic mathematics.

Commercial software such as Mathematica and Maple exist to aid in these problems. Unfortunately due to their closed nature it is difficult to integrate them into existing code bases.

{\bf Blab about statistics}
Society is starting to care about uncertainty.

We introduce random variable types into SymPy allowing high level and intuitive expression of statistical problems. We show how these expressions may then be compiled to a lower-level representation and computed to obtain results in laboratory problems.
