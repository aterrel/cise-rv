\subsection{Sidebar - Statistical Functions}

Random variables may be formed either by specifying probability density functions or by using one of the several builtin classes i.e. 
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> X = Normal(0,1) # Normal random variable with mean 0, standard deviation 1
>>> Y = Exponential(5) # Exponential random variable with rate 5
>>> D = Die(6) # A six sided die
\end{lstlisting}

Complex expressions and conditions are built up in SymPy I.e.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> expr = 2*X + Y
>>> cond = X>0
\end{lstlisting}

The following functions may be used to make queries:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> E(expr) # Expectation Value of an expression
>>> var(expr) # Variance of an expression
>>> P(cond) # Probability of an event
>>> Density(expr) # The probability density function (pdf) of an expression
>>> Sample(expr) # A single realization of the given expression
>>> Where(cond) # A domain of possible values where the condition is true
>>> Given(expr, cond) - A new random expression conditioned on cond being true
\end{lstlisting}

The functionality of the last function allows for more complex queries such as 
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> P(X>1, X>0) - Probability of X>1 given that we already know X>0
\end{lstlisting}
