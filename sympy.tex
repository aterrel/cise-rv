\textit{"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries."}

SymPy has much of the same functionality as Mathematica or Maple but, because SymPy is open source and pure Python, it is easy to integrate its functionality into other research projects. Several projects exist which make use of SymPy in different disciplines. Examples include Sage, (Andy add things - cite ignition maybe?)
